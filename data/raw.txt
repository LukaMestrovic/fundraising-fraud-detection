We are deeply saddened to inform you that our dear friend and colleague Mariappan Subramanian died in a tragic road accident in Hillsborough County, Tampa, FL. The incident happened on Monday 15 May 2023 around 7:30 pm EST. He was hit by a car at a pedestrian crossing. Though Mari had the right of the way, the car driver apparently, jumped the red light from what we came to know. Mariappan was 32 and is survived by his wife Krishnu and their 4-year-old son Rithvik who are living in India. Mariappan recently relocated from Jacksonville to Tampa. We are initiating this fundraiser on behalf of Mrs. Mariappan and seeking your generous support. Your contributions will entirely go to the surviving family. We cannot fill the void in the family caused by Mari's early departure, however, we hope that these contributions will make a positive difference in their future. Besides that, we are working with the local community groups in Tampa and Jacksonville to send the mortal remains to Mariappan's family in India. Thank you. -Anand",

    "text": "To everyone who loves Emmie…  Thank you for thinking of her and sending her the strength that she will need to recover. Emmie was airlifted to an Arizona Trauma Center on Monday, April 15th after the horse she was riding spun and fell on top of her during a Cattle movement at a Ranch she's been working on.  She has for all intents and purposes been unconscious since that event. It's important to note that Emmie was still recovering from a concussion sustained last month when she was thrown from a bucking horse onto a fence railing.  She also has a broken finger from that incident. Her mom is with her at the hospital along with numerous doctors, surgeons, nurses and specialists are managing her care and monitoring her vitals. She has not been medicated or sedated yet because of the brain injury, persistent swelling and bleeding all confirmed by a full body MRI.  Because of this she will remain unconscious for awhile.  Emmie sustained at least two skull fractures and is still bleeding from her ears.  The Neurosurgeon indicated that 3 to 4 more days of monitoring and progress are necessary to give a reasonable prognosis for recovery.  Apparently these types of injuries are quite unpredictable.  Her stay at the hospital will likely be a couple of weeks in duration.  She will remain in ICU for at least 10 more days.  It's still early in this process, yet it's becoming clear that at best she's going to need months to recover to a satisfactory level.  That's subject to change obviously.  So if that's accurate we'll need to sort out where to best do that recovery.  It's unlikely she'll be able to fly.  Maybe not even drive for some time.  All of those decisions will get made over the next week or two. Thanks for being there for her.  Please keep rooting for her speedy recovery.",

This is NOT a GoFundMe for my family. We are not in need. This Go Fund Me is to help me carry out Nick's wishes, Nick's hopes and dreams. You see, his work was not finished here. He had so much more work to do, so much more to give to this world. Our family will be committed to him and his legacy for the rest of our lives. I am lost and broken right now. I feel untethered. Everything we did was WITH or FOR Nick. His work MUST continue. He was a teacher... a mentor...a leader.. an inspiration and a CHANGER!!! My Nick was autistic and non-speaking yet he spoke to the world in SO many ways. He wanted to be a chef..he loved cooking (and eating!) He wanted to work in or own a restaurant. He was set free from a life of silence when he learned how to spell when he was 12 years old thanks to SOMA in TEXAS. I met my son, truly met him there. We brought this communication method to Staten Island and although it took some time for people to believe, Nick forged on and never gave up. Instead, he flourished and taught us all that NON-SPEAKING DID NOT MEAN NON THINKING. He explained beautifully that he and others were in a body that does not cooperate and he struggled daily to stay regulated and focused. Nick wanted to free so many others and get them ALL SPELLING! We did so much public speaking and He would encourage parents and teachers and friends to presume competency and believe in their kids. He truly changed the world. Teachers, paras, parents, direct support staff, family and friends said they would never look at another autistic person the same way after meeting Nicholas. He was a CHANGER. God gifted him to us 25 ago and I was so blessed to be his mother. I will honor his legacy for the rest of my days. His work MUST and WILL continue. I always told him how significant his life was...that he had such a purpose here on earth. I wanted him to know this!!! And He Knew it!! He used to spell to me MOM I LOVE YOU SO MUCH WE MAKE THE GREATEST TEAM TOGETHER  YES-YES NICK WE DO. He wanted to start a revolution as he called it, to bring Spelling to Communicate to the masses. We were just beginning this incredible work with CrimsonRise where Nick was a founder with his friends, Tejas Rao Sankar, Cristofer Puleo and Will Jusino the first organization led by non-speaking autistic individuals. If you can imagine our joy as we were told that CrimsonRise will be building a center they are going to name THE NICHOLAS D'AMORA CENTER FOR SPELLING AND ADVOCACY !!! Our Nick would be in complete joy and shock !!! He was a PIONEER and truly left this world a better place. I make this ask....please share this Go Fund ME EVERYWHERE! I want to share this with The GRACE Foundation, an organization that I helped found 22 years ago inspired by Nick. and CrimsonRise these are our two legacies that will help many others that will come after my NICK, this was HIS DREAM. CrimsonRise needs a home...a building... a space to call our own to expand to serve many. This is my goal to make this happen in his memory. The GRACE foundation is currently expanding and will be building a beautiful kitchen in Nick's memory. It will be called NICKY's KITCHEN!! He would be over the moon..with places named after him!! Please please help me to make this happen for these two incredible organizations. If you have been blessed with the means to help us please do....anything will help. If you weren't that's ok too, but maybe you can share this with someone who HAS BEEN BLESSED!! I WANT AND NEED the WORLD TO KNOW MY SON AND HIS INCREDIBLE LEGACY. PLEASE speak his name out loud Nicholas D'Amora THE CHANGER! ****If you would like to make your contribution tax deductible you can donate directly to the organizations in Nicholas' memory at the following links. www.graceofny.org and www.crimsonrise.org #NICKTHECHANGER",

    "text": "On the day before Mother's Day, Leah Moses received the most horrifying news a mother could imagine: Her beloved son, Om, was shot and killed. Amplifying this horror was the fact that it was her ex-husband who violently ended her son’s life.  Adding to the weight of the worst news any parent could receive was the fact that she had tried to warn law enforcement, child protective services and the courts that her ex-husband was an abuser – for over fifteen years!   FIFTEEN YEARS!  The Utah system that is meant to protect women and children completely failed. So, as a longtime advocate for domestic abuse survivors and as a survivor herself, Leah wants to make sure her son’s death was not in vain but that this tragic moment results in systemic change. She asks that everyone that reads this letter contacts their legislators requesting they support the Keeping Children Safe From Family Violence Act a.k.a. Kayden's Law, a system-changing piece of legislation Leah has been working on this past year that ironically if passed, could have protected her son. She hopes that by passing this law, other children will be saved. Leah also requests that those moved by whom Om was as a person and by his tragic death, donate to Om’s Memorial Fund. This fund will be used to help pass Kayden's Law and expand the Safe Harbor Crisis Center, the only domestic violence and sexual assault survivor service in Davis County. It is also paramount to Leah and her family that Om’s life is celebrated and that our larger Utah community knows what an incredible young man he was at the tender age of 16.   Every heartfelt memory from friends and family has emphasized above all else the kind and thoughtful young man that Om was. Om always looked out for others, and friends knew he was genuine in his caring. He endured years of witnessing abuse of every kind imaginable, yet in the quiet strength of his soul, he cared most about protecting his younger sister and his mother. Not surprisingly, he was adored by all his cousins who looked up to him as the oldest boy in the family. Om loved camping at the beach and kayaking lakes and rivers with the cousins, was a whiz at math, enjoyed basketball games, and had a creative sense of humor and an infectious laugh. His soft eyes and gentle smile warmed anyone who was blessed to know him. Family gatherings were always his happy place, as was playing music. He taught himself to play the piano, played the bass clarinet and drums, and was a gifted saxophone player. Sadly, Om had his saxophone in hand the day he was senselessly murdered. Om had so much living still to do, and it breaks all our hearts that his beautiful life was cut short because the system meant to protect him completely failed.   Om, you will live in our hearts forever! We love you!  (At Leah's request, please donate to Om’s Memorial Fund here in lieu of flowers, meals and other acts of kindness. To leave a message of support check your emailed donation receipt. THANK YOU!) **About the coordinator of this memorial fund: My name is Cherise Udell and I have been a close friend of Leah and her family for over 15 years. All proceeds generated by this fundraiser will go to Leah Moses who will then split the proceeds between Safe Harbor and lobbying for the Keep Children Safe from Family Violence Act. If you want to get more involved with the passing of this legislation in Utah, please check back here for updates. Thank you for caring. - Cherise Udell** https://www.ksl.com/article/50647031/mother-of-teen-murdered-by-his-father-says-the-system-failed-her   ",

    "text": "Hello everyone, let us introduce you to Jessica Hanna. She is a 40 year old homeschooling mother of 4 young children all under the age of 8 years old. In December of 2020 she was diagnosed with breast cancer while she was only 14 weeks pregnant. She denied termination and was determined to bring her son into the world while still conquering cancer by the help of God’s immense mercy and grace. Surgery while pregnant revealed she had a whopping 13cm tumour with a 43 lymph nodes positive. She was deemed likely terminal. Through the intercession of Blessed Fr. Solanus Casey, uniting her Cross with Christ, running to the Sacraments of the Church and the power of prayer via friends, relatives and her instagram family, Jessica was miraculously clear of all cancer 2 weeks after her son Thomas Solanus was born! However, on December 12th 2022, on the feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe, cancer had returned stage 4 and terminal. She quickly sprang into action and has tried conventional medical treatments which have thus far failed…the cancer has appeared to spread to many more lymph nodes, bones and lung. Her health has seen a big decline. At this point she needs to take action by seeking treatment at other hospital systems outside of her state for clinical trials as well as integrate very costly alternative therapies out of country that have been shown to help fight and kill cancer. Medical bills are mounting as well as the need for travel costs and extra childcare while she fights her battle. We are humbly asking for help with these costs, allowing our best friend to search for something that can save her life so she can be here for her 4 beautiful children and husband. Ultimately, God is the divine physician, and more than your donation we ask for your continued prayers petitioning our Lord to allow this cup to pass from her, if it be His holy will. Jessica had always believed in the power of prayer and she knows the Lord has delivered her once from the jaws of the lion and thus He can deliver her from this Philistine (1 Samuel 17:37)! Thank you, God bless you and be assured of all of our prayers as we, with great confidence, “Thank God Ahead of Time” …and as Jessica always famously says “ONWARD!”",

Surprisingly last year of July, I was feeling very unwell and was hospitalized, after the reports came in the Dr stated that I have a Chronic Kidney Disease and both of my Kidneys have been severely damaged. I was hospitalized for months and i had to go for several follow ups. I was at bedrest at my house for more than 6 months. I was depressed as well as scared thinking about of my future and my family and was unable to go to work. The doctors told me me that the only way to survive was through a kidney transplant. In order to do the kidney transplant, the wait time could be around 5-6 years in the US. Being the only son in the family and the financial pillar for my family, I want to fight for my life one more time. For this, I need to go to India for the kidney transplant but this could cost around USD 80k-90k. I need your help to get the Kidney transplant and for me to stay alive for my family. I am creating this gofund me to get any financial support that I can get. I hope all my well wishers will understand my situation and help me.Thank you",

He died in his mothers arms on Mothers' Day!TJ suffered life threatening injuries from this senseless act and was held by his mother until officials arrived. One thing about TJ is he was always smiling. That kid could light up a room in seconds! It was just last week he helped one of our foster moms out to the car with some puppies, they laughed the entire way out because the puppies were getting heavy and foster mom needed several breaks!

At approximately 5:10, Monday evening, May 15,2023, Matthew, Grayson, and Elijah were walking down the driveway after getting off the bus, when lightning came out of the sky without warning, and entered Matthew's body and traveled to Grayson, since they were holding hands. It is with a sad heart that I let you know the father, Matthew Boggs, 34, of Valley Mills, TX, did not make it. I am here to beg for your prayers and help. Grayson is a 6 year old little boy who is currently fighting for his life at the Children's Hospital in Temple, Texas. He is currently on a vent and is having seizures.

Please if you are not in a place to donate, please, please, please share! Thank you for your prayers, kindness, and generosity.

We are asking for your help as we face a difficult journey as a young family without a lot of monetary resources. On Thursday, May 11, we were given the news that Eyal has cancer. We are devastated. Eyal has been in a lot of pain for several months and we thought that it was back pain related to his drumming, and then we thought it might be related to a chest infection. Now we know that cancer has been growing in his body and attacking his bones, lungs, liver and lymph nodes. For anyone who doesn't know Eyal, you are missing out! He's funny, caring, honest, loving, determined, encouraging. He's the BEST partner and the BEST dad there ever was. He's an incredible drummer and an inspiration to so many people, always approaching life with passion and love. Together, Eyal and I own the Oakland Drum School and have been blessed to see it grow slowly to a beautiful musical family of 8 teachers and over 100 students. The majority of our income comes from Eyal teaching drums and recording drums for other musicians, and he will be stepping away from all of this for the foreseeable future. We are homeschooling our little boys and we spend a lot of time together as a family, in nature, in our garden in Pinole, California, playing music and dancing. We are raising money for the long road ahead on this cancer journey that we are suddenly faced with. Some of the things we plan to use the money for: Paying our mortgage and the general living expenses while Eyal is not workingConsultation so we make the best and most informed treatment plan for Eyal.Therapy outside our insurance that will help Eyal's recovery.Childcare while we go for Eyal's treatments. Please help us if you are able. Anything helps. All our love,Jasmine, Eyal, Kaleo and Ocean",

The money will go to Margot, who is handling all of Kris' affairs and home care** On February 5, Kris slipped and fractured her shoulder walking into work on Grammys show day. A month later, she had surgery but was struggling with recovery. Unfortunately, most her symptoms were attributed to post-surgery side effects, when in fact it was her cancer that returned. Kris was rushed to the ICU last week due to her rapid decline and alarmingly low blood pressure. It was then sadly confirmed that after 5 years in remission, her breast cancer has spread to her liver, spine, stomach lining and lymph nodes. It is stage 4. The decision has been made to stop treatment and move her to home hospice care at Margot Carlson’s house where she can be comfortable and spend however much time is left with her dog, Pearl. Unfortunately there’s limited resources for the type of care that Kris needs and deserves. While the home hospice care is covered by insurance, we need help getting 24-hour nurses.

Dimitri is a charismatic, upbeat soul with a personality that can light up any room and a music taste that can unite everyone regardless of genre or culture. He was unfortunately in a vehicular accident in Atlanta, Georgia which caused him to have a traumatic brain injury and other severe injuries. Our world stopped when we learned our brother, nephew, son, and friend to some, was severely injured ONE day before being back home with us in New York City. We are now faced with challenges due to him being in another state as he is not accessible to us because of the long distance. To have him transported to us, would cost a minimum of $30,000. In addition to the medical bills to keep him stable, and rehabilitation services to get him back on track toward recovery. We are asking for any support and prayers to help get Dimitri back home so that he can be fully supported and cared for. Every small contribution will have a great impact on helping us reach our goal. This situation shows the fragility of life as anything can happen at any time to anyone. Be sure to hug your family members check on them and be there for them. We would have never fathomed this happening to us.

He didn't have his phone. He mistakenly went to the wrong house, one block away from the house where his siblings were. He pulled into the driveway and rang the doorbell. The man in the home opened the door, looked my nephew in the eye, and shot him in the head. My nephew fell to the ground, and the man shot him again. Ralph was then able to get up and run to the neighbor's house, looking for help.Unfortunately, he had to run to 3 different homes before someone finally agreed to help him after he was told to lie on the ground with his hands up. Ralph Pual Yarl is a fantastic kid, and I am not just saying this because he is my nephew. He truly is. At school, he is a member of the Technology Student Association and Science Olympia Team. Jazz and competition band. He is a section leader in the marching band; a scholar and one of the top bass clarinet players in Missouri. He recently earned Missouri All-State Band recognition with an honorable mention. He plays multiple instruments in the metropolitan youth orchestra. He is a 2022 Missouri scholar academy alumni. Ralph can often be found with a musical instrument. He loves them all. Last summer, Ralph attended Missouri Scholar’s Academy, where he got a full college life experience. His goal is to attend Texas A&M to major in chemical Engineering. When asked how he plans to get into this university, he said, “Well, if they have a scholarship for music or academics, I know I can get it.” Ralph's teacher and friends describe him as “ a kind soul,” “quiet,” “friendly,” “well-mannered,” “always willing to help,” “super smart,” and a “musical genius.” Ralph was looking forward to graduating high school and finally getting the opportunity to visit West Africa before starting college. Life looks a lot different right now. Even though he is doing well physically, he has a long road ahead mentally and emotionally. The trauma that he has to endure and survive is unimaginable. He is our miracle. We have heard these types of stories many times, and unfortunately, most black boys are not alive to get another chance. Ralph deserves to have the future that he has dreams about. He deserves to be the light that shows the world that LOVE wins and that humanity is still Good. However, he will need a lot of help to get there. Funds from this account will be used for his medical bills and therapy. Any additional funds will be use for college expenses at Texas A&M, a trip to West Africa, and other expenses. Thank you",

    "text": "As many of you know, Tres and Julia Salerno and their three kids Luci, Dru, and Maezey just lost their home in a fire on Saturday (May 13th). The Salernos are some of the kindest, most generous people we know and they lost just about everything, including their two beloved dogs, Tiki and Ophie. Much of what wasn't burned was destroyed by smoke, ash, and water. The outpouring of support from the community has been inspiring. Many people have been wanting to help, but feel unsure of how to do so. This campaign is to help bridge that gap. This way they can use the funds for whatever is required, whether it's the insurance deductible, the veterinary bill, or furniture for a rental home. Your donations, of all sizes, are much appreciated. Thanks in advance for your support and love for this family.",

    "text": "Hello! My name is Sara and I am putting together this donation site for The Nicolet Family; Shawna, Travis, Bas, Kyuss, and Tiago. If you know them at all, you know they're a wonderful, driven, very adventurous bunch. They get to live on their 43' sailboat, the Niniwahuni. They sailed down to Mexico in October 2020 and have been living there ever since. Over time, they developed their dream to cross the Pacific. Niniwahuni departed from Banderas Bay, Nayarit, Mexico March 13, 2023; destination Nuku Hiva, Marquesas Islands, French Polynesia. Unfortunately, almost 2 weeks and 900 nautical miles into their journey, they were hit by a terrible storm (up to 15 ft waves and 30 kt winds) that ended up de-masting their sailboat (their home.) This is one of the worst emergencies that could happen while at sea. They activated their emergency plan and got the US Coast Guard involved. The USCG diverted a tanker to rescue them; Shawna and the boys got on the tanker on 03/24, and it is now headed to Hawaii so they can disembark. As a family, they made the impossible decision to have Travis stay with the vessel and attempt to salvage it (it is their home, everything they have.) He is still out in the Pacific, roughly 400 nautical miles from Clarion Island; the first goal for him to get to before deciding on next steps. He is not out of danger, but there is an enormous effort underway and a plan in place to help him get what he needs. This family has been living through a nightmare and has some unforeseen expenses (repair of the vessel, travel, etc.) that will be arising. If you can help monetarily in any way, please consider donating to them. If you are unable to do so, please send your thoughts, prayers, love, energy, vibes, or whatever other positivity you have into the universe so they can all be together and safe soon!",

    "text": "We are families of over two decades of previous mass shootings from across this country. Our hearts are breaking for the victims and survivors of the mass shooting at the Allen, TX Outlet Mall where 8 people were murdered, 3 are in critical condition, and 4 are stable in area hospitals on May 6, 2023. We are the same families of previous mass shootings who collected donations for Uvalde, TX school shooting victims and ensured that 100% went directly to them. We will do the same again for our new, unfortunate mass shooting family in Allen. Our families of previous mass shootings have been re-victimized when nonprofits say they are collecting donations for victims but do not actually give donations directly to victims. VictimsFirst's philosophy is very different. We believe in full transparency, honoring donor intent and providing the victims the opportunity to choose for themselves how to spend your generous financial gifts meant for them. We, VictimsFirst have started this fund so the victims’ families and those wounded are protected from fraud and exploitation. You can read more about what we do and who we are at www.victimsfirst.org. VictimsFirst will work with local victim advocates to distribute these funds. We are hoping to collect $150,000.00 so that each person directly impacted by this mass shooting in Allen can receive $10,000.00. If we exceed this amount, we will still divide the final amount collected equitably. If the National Compassion Fund is called upon, we will grant the donations to them—or another trusted organization that creates a centralized victims fund that guarantees 100% will go directly to victims. We are all volunteers and are managing multiple funds due to the rash of mass shootings. We take no admin fee. Thank you for your compassion and kindness. All donations will be designated specifically for the victims of the Allen Outlet Mall shooting. VictimsFirst's EIN is 32-0656956. If you'd rather, you may send a check directly to VictimsFirst and designate it for Allen Mall at: 4195 Chino Hills Parkway #593Chino Hills, CA 91709",

The lawlessness and gang violence that dominates Haiti’s capital city has reached its hilly suburbs. Haiti is in crisis, and the chaos is knocking on the door of the orphanage and school, run by author and philanthropist Mitch Albom since the devastating earthquake of 2010. Following emergency instructions, we stayed low and away from the windows, and remained in lockdown for the rest of the day. By 7, news of the escalation’s peak would make the rounds in WhatsApp threads and panicked texts: a crowd burned 13 suspected gangsters to death in a gruesome outburst of vigilante violence. Just half-a-mile from our grounds. Haiti is in crisis. Armed with machetes, bottles, and rocks, residents in the hilly suburbs of Haiti’s capital fought back against encroaching gangs throughout Tuesday, as the orphanage remained on lockdown. Sleep would not come again for 24 hours, but the bullets did. Thankfully, emergency procedures kept the children and staff who live, learn, play and work at Have Faith Haiti indoors safe — but only as safe as current conditions allow. By Wednesday, a panicked phone call to Mitch Albom in the U.S. announced that a gang member had trespassed onto the property. The belief would prove to be unfounded, but the fear remains. What would happen if it were true? Haiti is in crisis. And it’s in our neighborhood — the one we moved to last year for safety and growth. A neighborhood that has largely avoided the gang-fueled violence that has been consuming the capital and surrounding areas since the July 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse. Change can happen in an instant, and it has. Our ability to continue investing in the lives of our Haitian children is at risk and our safety plans have accelerated. We need to immediately build a “safe house” by converting the top floor of a building into a bulletproof space with stocked supplies. We need security cameras and floodlights to illuminate nearly 7 acres of property to alert us to armed trespassers. And we need to hire more trained and armed security guards. These threats are not going away. We must find a way to better secure our grounds so we can keep our children and staff safe and continue to fulfill our mission and vision to bring hope, leadership, and generational change to Haiti through the children we serve.Have Faith Haiti provides safety, nourishment, education, and opportunity for Haiti’s impoverished children and orphans. We provide a loving home in Port-au-Prince where children can thrive personally, academically, and spiritually. After graduating from our bilingual academy, our children have the opportunity to attend college in the U.S. and return home as changemakers and leaders in the Haitian community. This fall, we’ll have eleven children attending college in the United States and one, our oldest, beginning medical school at Michigan State University. Have Faith Haiti is a project of the nonprofit organization, A Hole in the Roof Foundation. This is hope for Haiti, a nation in crisis. **If you need to give offline, checks may be sent to Have Faith Haiti Mission c/o A Hole in the Roof Foundation / 29836 Telegraph Road / Southfield, MI 48034 with “safe house” in memo line.

In their second year, they took third place at their regional event and qualified for the World Championships! The problem: they could not afford to go. We need to change that for this year! Our school is 40% Free and Reduced lunch, which means about 40% of the school experiences financial hardship, and our team makeup reflects this percentage. Therefore, big trips like this that come up at the last minute are even more challenging to afford, and the girls did not get to go. (By all projections, they would have been in the Top 5 in the World rankings.) The girls have worked hard, and HAVE QUALIFIED for the World Championships AGAIN, and it's my mission to help make this trip happen! I want to reward their determination and perseverance, but also want them to be inspired at the next level, to fan the flames and push them farther than they thought. There are no seniors on this team, so we are not only inspiring these girls, but helping them to inspire others! I've won a few awards for supporting girls in STEM, and having successful peers become the messenger is key to getting even more girls involved in STEM. Our biggest challenge is that issue of travel with short-term notice: we only have about 4 weeks notice to fly from Atlanta to Denver. When writing this summary we saw flights, hotels, van rental and other costs approaching $10,000 for the whole group. All funds would be used for the group to travel. Estimated costs: Flights $4000Hotels $3000Van/transportation $1200Extra baggage fees for the robot, tools, etc $500Food, unknowns $1000 If we are lucky enough to raise more than our goal, we would invest those funds into STEM activities in our community that our Sea Cows could run for other young girls, especially for recruiting girls that cannot typically afford STEM camps and other similar enrichment. I've never used GoFundMe before, as a teacher or any other purpose, but these girls deserve every effort I can give. We appreciate any help YOU can offer! Help me to create some of the STEM leaders of tomorrow. Thank you!",

For several months, she fought hard and was strong for her family throughout the process. Never once was she negative, she praised God throughout the journey and gave Him the glory, no matter the outcome. Our mother, before passing said, I want something good to come out of me having Cancer. And through this, her idea was born. Our mother, Donna Buddon Crider, was an educator for over 30 years. Her passion was teaching. She loved the classroom and adored her students. In her memory and in her honor, it was her wish that instead of flowers, those who loved and cared about her would also believe in her mission of education and would donate to a passion project that is near and dear to her heart. Donna Buddon Crider would like you to please donate to her old high school, Manning's School in Savanna-la-Mar, Westmoreland, Jamaica. Mannings School started offering classes in 1738. It is the oldest continuously operating high school in Jamaica, operating for 285 years and becoming a heritage site. The school's motto is rendered in latin Vita sine litteris mors est and its English translation is Life without learning is death. And so, Donna lived her life and her career as a passionate educator, believing that to teach and educate was to give life to others. She daily ensured that her students learned well and learned much. It was there at Manning's School that Donna's passion to become an educator was discovered and fostered. She graduated in 1977. Your donation will contribute to several student initiatives and restoration projects to keep the school thriving. It is our hope to continue funding and assisting with quality education so that students can learn, grow, and ultimately pursue their passions as well. Thank you all for your donations, and thank you for honoring Donna Buddon Crider and for assisting in giving back to help others. God Bless you!",

    "text": "Greetings to you all! My name is Paddington Mbumbgwa. I am an international student from Zimbabwe, studying biochemistry and mathematics at Warren Wilson College (WWC) in Swannanoa, NC. I've created this Gofundme page to raise funds to attend medical school at Loma Linda School of Medicine in California starting in the fall of 2023. Being a doctor is a dream I have been working towards since I was still a young village boy in a rural part of Zimbabwe. Your giving to this campaign will touch a life and also give a rural boy, who was once told many times that he cannot make it, a chance to achieve his goals and dreams and, ultimately make a difference in people’s lives as a physician. Wait! Before I present my case in detail, who am I? My story will tell you a few things about my background, career choice, undergraduate endeavors, future plans, and finally, why I am asking for your assistance. WHO AM I?My journey from my rural village of Murehwa in Zimbabwe to WWC began with my grandmother, Gogo. She raised me since I was a little boy. My mother gave birth to me when she was 18 years old. My father, I learned, died in 2017, but I only met him once in my entire life. He and my mother divorced when my mother was pregnant with me and as far as I know, never spoke again. When I was two years old, my mother got married, leaving me with my grandmother. Despite my mother living nearby, Gogo has been the loving mother I’ve grown up with. Men in our culture do not want to be bothered by other men’s children, so I could only see my mother the few times she was allowed to visit. My grandmother and I.Gogo lived under the poverty line in a village that itself was struggling, but she sheltered and fed me, teaching me the value of hard work and faith. I lived in a household with at least 10 people including two of my siblings. I am the first one to have a high school diploma. We were struggling to survive. I spent many hours with Gogo, weeding tobacco at the big farms, and harvesting peas and runner beans to earn a living. When the food aid came, our family name would be at the top of the list, receiving more than the rest of the village. I thought we were favored, but later I realized we were the family in the most need of the entire village. While it was painful for me to see Gogo working so hard at her advanced age, it was also inspiring. She never complained; she only stopped working when she started having foot problems. Similarly, I will work as hard as I can to reach my target until it’s impossible for me to do so. WHY MEDICINE?She stared at me without blinking. The deep desire to speak that I could see in her eyes was thwarted by her paralyzed lips. I could only imagine that she wanted to say goodbye before facing fate, which appeared to be inevitable at this point in her sickness. These dark days were only exacerbated by knowing that there was nothing that my family or I could do to save our dear mother. By her bedside lay a concoction of lemons, ashes, and holy water from the shaman, which we hoped could ease her pain and make her final moments more bearable. This, for me, was the experience that set me on a path toward medicine. At 17, I had to care for my mother at our residence deep in the countryside of Zimbabwe after she became ill from Herpes. One of the few doctors in the country who could treat her was in the city of Harare, about 100 miles away. We had traveled to his office many times, only to be turned away because many other people were waiting for his services. Drugs to ease the pain were not only too expensive for us to afford but also challenging to find. Desperate to help our mother as we waited for the medical consultation to be made available, we resorted to home remedies. Contrary to the promises from the local traditional healer who supplied us with the concoctions, the supposed treatments did not improve my mother’s condition. With each passing day, she deteriorated as the blisters on her face widened. My grandmother and I took turns feeding and cleaning my mother. Frequently, I skipped school because I feared that I would return in the evening on one of those dark days to find her gone. As her disease progressed, she became immobile. Sometimes, she would just sit by the couch, tears streaming down her bony cheeks. I knew that she not only felt the pain but also the unspoken stigma that our community exuded. In my culture, when a member of the community falls ill, neighbors and relatives often visit to provide support. However, because most people in the village knew that my mother suffered from Herpes, they associated her illness with prostitution. Instead of receiving sympathy, my family received judgment. After what felt like a lifetime to me, my mother was finally treated and slowly recovered. I experienced great joy seeing her recuperate, but the experience of watching my mother suffer, almost to the point of death, left an indelible mark in my life. I knew I wanted to be a physician for the first time. Towards my newfound purpose to be a physician, I made every effort to succeed in school. During the day, I worked on a local tobacco farm to raise funds for my tuition. At night, under candlelight, I consumed copious amounts of information as I prepared for my national examinations. My fascination with medicine and drug development led me to the world of biomedical research. I was keen to understand how scientists develop medications to tackle human diseases such as Herpes and save lives, including my mother’s. After excelling at school, I started looking for college opportunities in the United States. I was convinced that if I were to get a college education in the United States, I would also gain exposure to cutting-edge biomedical research. I was privileged to get accepted into a program called the United States Student Achievers Program (USAP), which provided me with the financial means to apply to Warren Wilson College successfully. I could not believe my eyes on the day I received the admission letter. Getting a chance to move to the U.S. was the best thing that happened in my life. In it, I saw an opportunity that would allow me to help people like my mother as a physician in the future. Coming to the U.S., I was ready to explore different areas of study that WWC could offer. However, my mind was primarily focused on medicine. It informed my choice of majors in college: biochemistry and mathematics. Outside the classroom, I sought more opportunities to learn about medicine. One of my most profound experiences was when I shadowed a urologist. I marveled at seeing him easily removing a kidney stone, a condition that had claimed our neighbor’s life while I was still in Zimbabwe. The doctor removed a kidney stone using robotic surgery, and the patient went home the next day. The operation looked simple from this side of the Atlantic, but I knew that accessing such treatment remains a challenge for most people at home. Seeing the patient leave the hospital the next day following the kidney stone removal solidified my goal to earn a medical degree in the U.S. and to help people who do not have access to care in my home country. I live with those who are underserved like my mother in mind and constantly recall the experience I had when my mother was sick. This and many other experiences have kept me grounded and focused on my goals. These experiences always remind me of my calling in this world. I COULD NOT ASK FOR MORE THAN BEING AT WARREN WILSON COLLEGE.My journey to pursue my goal was made largely possible by the supportive, welcoming, and caring nature of Warren Wilson College (WWC). WWC installed service and leadership as core values in my life in addition to my other values like an accomplishment, excellence, family, faith, equality, accessibility, education, justice, and research. Therefore, I actively engaged in both service and leadership opportunities during my undergraduate career. Firstly, I volunteered at Asheville Buncombe Community Christian Medical Ministry in Asheville, an organization that offers free clinics to uninsured Buncombe County adults. The clinic provides them with access to medical care and dental care. I helped print and file patients' health information, receiving and collecting donations. The breadth of the experience showed me some of the nuanced difficulties associated with healthcare accessibility and cemented my goal to serve medically underserved communities in the future. Additionally, I volunteered with Asheville Writers In The Schools And Community in Asheville, NC as a peer mentor to students of color. I hosted a study hall for these students weekly for an hour and a half, helping them with math homework and clarifying some math concepts. My greatest desire was to devote my time and energy to these students in the hopes that I would be able to offer them services I did not have as a child: better educational resources and support. After spending about two months with these students, their progress in understanding and solving math problems left me fulfilled. I volunteered at Mission Hospital in Asheville, NC. As part of my assigned duties, I escorted patients who use wheelchairs from their rooms to the discharge suite, where nurses gave them discharge instructions. Also, Amid the COVID pandemic, I volunteered with Hands-On Asheville-Buncombe, providing emotional support to the elderly in Asheville, NC. Every week for about 3 months, I connected with up to 6 vulnerable people through letter writing. Often, I would receive calls from people I connected with, and they would express not only their gratitude but also share their stories with me. The privilege of hearing about their life stories emphasized the multifaceted nature of healthcare delivery and the importance of community health services. Throughout my semesters at Warren Wilson college, I have held different leadership positions which include some of the following; (1)Student Government Association(SGA)Co-president- I facilitated SGA weekly meetings, ensuring that SGA upholds its mission both with students and administration. My role includes gathering and bringing students’ concerns to the administration, setting the meeting agendas, facilitating the discussion, and maintaining accurate minutes, (2)Student Health Ambassador -I was one of five students selected to be Student Health Ambassadors at Warren Wilson College. My role was to promote safer health practices during the pandemic to mitigate the spread of the virus. I used Instagram, emails, and posters to spread awareness. I also assisted with rapid antigen covid-19 testing during the student’s move-in in the fall of 2020. Post-move-in, I led the Pen-Pal program, which connected students from our college to those learning at other colleges in Western North Carolina to reduce the sense of isolation, (3) Peer Group Leader-I assisted first-year students' orientation, helped them connect to campus resources, and led Lessons in Navigating College sessions, allowing them to adapt and get familiarized with the environment efficiently, (4) Peer tutoring-I tutored general chemistry, calculus, statistics, and physics, (5) Peer Supplementary Instructor-Delivered general chemistry supplemental sessions, (6) Science writing fellow- Helped students by providing students with catered feedback and the opportunity to discuss assignments, encouraging the knowledge and writing skills of new science writers. With unconditional support from faculty and staff from WWC, I was able to maximize my research experience both at WWC and away which I believe is the key to my success in medical school and beyond. Firstly, I have worked in the genetics lab at Warren Wilson College under Dr. Hove, where I get involved in various projects. The workflow includes studying plants and animal genetics using techniques like DNA extraction, DNA Barcoding, PCR etc. protocols. I had a chance to exercise and learn ways of logical reasoning to identify, think through, and solve problems. Genetics crewI was given opportunities and support from WWC which opened many doors for me. For example, In the summer of 2021, I was one of the few applicants selected to be Bob Simpson Scholars at NC State University across the country. Under Dr. Tal's mentorship, I investigated unprecedented spring oyster demise in NC. The experience taught me to troubleshoot and pay attention to detail. Also, I was selected to be one of ten students selected to participate in the Summer Biomedical Research at Brody School of Medicine in the summer of 2022. Under Dr. Sriramuls's, I aimed to understand the involvement of Kinin B1 receptors (B1R) in cardiac fibrosis. Fig 3: The lab I conducted cardiac fibrosis research in the summer of 2022. From this experience, I learned the importance of keeping up to date with the scientific literature, which I believe will enable me to be a more effective physician by having the ability to effectively integrate novel discoveries within the science community into my medical practice. In a nutshell, I am ready for medical school and beyond, and WWC played a big part in this achievement. Last but not least, I have played college soccer since my first year in college, and I play in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division III. I have participated in three seasons (2019, 2020, and 2021). Besides the fact that soccer is my most incredible tool for relaxation, I consider myself lucky to be part of this team. It is the first club I joined after I came to the U.S. They played a crucial role in my transition to an entirely new way of life, especially in learning about American culture. The people I have met in this club and these experiences have enriched my social life, and I am deeply grateful for them. WHAT MADE LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE MY DREAM SCHOOL AFTER WWC? It is the nurturing ability of the WWC community that made my dream of getting accepted into medical school a reality, specifically the Loma Linda School of Medicine (LLUSM). I am incredibly motivated to attend LLUSM because the institution has programs that focus on serving underprivileged populations such as Loma Linda University's Medical Training Program (MTP). This is particularly because, having grown up surrounded by people living below the poverty line and witnessing the negative repercussions of healthcare firsthand, I have relatable experiences with the underserved population that will allow me to empathize, connect and serve them as a qualified professional. Therefore, earning my medical education at LLUSM would give me an opportunity to further understand a population that reflects my own personal background and equip me with knowledge and skills that will make me more efficient as a physician. Besides, the uniqueness of LLUSM to incorporate mission trips in their curriculum made it my dream school. I value this because growing up in the other part of the world where it is difficult to access health care gave me a deeper understanding of the need for global service. I want to be part of a community that thinks and cares about others from different parts of the world. I believe this experience will challenge me to think from a different perspective and learn about different cultural values which will help serve a diverse population. Furthermore, It is imperative to me that I continue my education at an institution like LLUSM, which also prioritizes community engagement. I was excited to learn that LLU medical students contribute more than 3,000 hours annually in local schools, shelters, and clinics, for example, the Community Kids Connection Academic Tutoring program. I believe I gained valuable tutoring skills, in addition to other skills like leadership and research during my time at WWC. I am looking forward to actively using these skills to make a difference in the Loma Linda community. SO WHAT AFTER MEDICAL SCHOOL?I am currently thinking of becoming a cardiologist. However, I am open to many possibilities due to the extensive exposure I am hoping to get at the Loma Linda School of Medicine. After residency, it is inevitable that I plan to practice medicine in underserved or disadvantaged communities. I am so convinced that I would not rest in my life until I build healthcare infrastructures like hospitals and clinics in my home country, Zimbabwe, where the lack of healthcare is apparent. The village contained virtually no doctors or hospitals. I know firsthand the deeper meaning of being deprived of the fundamental right to have access to health care due to economic burden and lack of healthcare professionals. I’m aware of the fact that many other people are going through a similar struggle that I went through growing up. By working with underserved populations, I believe I can play a personally satisfying role in addressing the healthcare disparities that affected me as a child. FINANCIAL SITUATION. I was informed that I am not eligible for any financial assistance from the institution for now. I have tried to apply for external scholarships but I would like to admit, it has been really difficult because of my visa status (F1-Visa). The majority of them, if not all I have encountered so far, need an applicant to be a US citizen or a Green Card Holder, but I am a non-eligible citizen. In addition to that, I have tried to explore loan options; however, it's so difficult because they require a cosigner and I do not have one since all my family is in Zimbabwe, and by far they do not have any credits to do that. I am here kindly asking for your support with any amount you can give. I have created this GoFundMe so that I can continue to pursue my dream. I hope to raise $80,000 for the first year. My biggest desire is to get started and I hope that I will be able to find some institutional aid after the first year. Here is the breakdown of the costs, and I have copied this information directly from the school. A deposit equal to the first year’s tuition and required fees (currently at $67,056) will be due no later than one week before orientationOther expenses for the year include books and supplies (currently at $2,517) and standard off-campus living expenses (currently at $1,955 per month for 10 months of enrollment) Also, if you know people, organizations or programs that can give scholarships, I would really appreciate it if you can let me know. Thank you for your time and consideration to help my cause,Paddington Mbumbgwa",

The impact has left him with a herniated intestine and a pre-pubic tendon tear, for which he will undergo emergency surgery on Monday to save his life. Anyone who's met Gumbo knows he's not just a pet; he is a cherished member of our family. He has brought immense joy, unconditional love and snuggles, and endless laughter into our lives. It breaks my heart to see him in so much pain, and I am determined to do everything in my power to give him the best chance at recovery. Unfortunately, the cost of the necessary surgery and hospital stay is $6,500+, which exceeds our financial capabilities as we are currently paying for our other pup, Maverick, to undergo chemotherapy for lymphoma. Every contribution, no matter the size, will make a tremendous difference in Gumbo's life. The funds raised will go directly towards covering the surgical expenses, 4+ day hospital stay, post-operative care, and any additional treatments required for his recovery. Our sweet baby deserves a chance to bounce back to his lively and playful self. We understand that not everyone can donate, but your support and well wishes mean the world to us. We will be forever grateful for any assistance you can provide in helping us give Gumbo the fighting chance he deserves. With sincere gratitude,Madison & Gumbo",

    "text": "One month ago, we received a plea for help regarding an orange tabby who had been abandoned by his owner who had apparently recently been evicted from her apartment in the city of Bell, CA. The videos showed the friendliest, sweetest cat climbing all over the finder, who had come across the cat at his jobsite and kindly began feeding him daily.We are having trouble attaching the video, but please click here: https://youtube.com/shorts/zadrjzuIaKM The finder networked for a rescue for the cat for one month before finding us who agreed to help as soon as we could find a foster. Despite many post shares, nobody ever offered to foster, so we decided to just get him off the streets and temporarily hold him ourselves while we continued the process of networking a foster for him. We asked the finder to try and track down any information about the previous owner and amazingly he was able to work with the building management to reach her and retrieve the cat’s vetting paperwork, as requested by us. We were shocked to see that the cat had been adopted from a nearby high-kill shelter at only 2 months old (will post his shelter intake photo here – absolute cutest intake photo we have ever seen). His name was Simba. He was now just shy of 2 years old and had already been disposed of like a piece of trash out onto the streets to fend for himself. How can anyone have the heart to do this? 2 weeks after we had Simba in our care, he began to have issues urinating. After 24 hours of just a light dribble and him starting to cry out in pain, we consulted with one of our RVT friends who directed us to take to an Emergency Hospital ASAP. Luckily MASH was able to see us urgently although we had to put down a $2000 deposit on our credit card (a huge amount for us). We were correct that he had a blockage but we did not know the severity of the problem. His bloodwork showed high potassium levels of 10 (vet said he was “at death’s door”), elevated kidney levels to the point of kidney failure, and she determined this was an FIC (Feline Idiopathic Cystitis), which is a blockage common in male cats that she believes in his case to be triggered by stress. Triggered by stress of losing his parent, losing his home, and being forced to fend for himself outside after living indoors only his entire life. It took a couple hours to get him unblocked and afterwards the vet told us that it was one of the worst blockage cases she had ever seen. They requested he be hospitalized for 2-3 more days and quoted us $6000. With over 45 cats under our small rescue, that was absolutely not an option for us. Operating solely on donations, we must use our limited funds very wisely to sustainably continue rescuing. All cats in our care are fully vetted prior to adoption, not to mention we currently have multiple senior cats under the rescue all who we have already spent $1000+ on and will likely be in our care for the rest of their lives. That being said, we of course wanted the best outcome for Simba, especially after the hell he had been through. The ER vet agreed to discharge him with us providing a regimen of subcutaneous fluids at home and administering all of his 3 medications he was to be sent home with as well as a special urinary diet. She told us there was very high chance he would become blocked again, and in that case, to take him directly to Kinder 4 Rescue (a local vet that works with rescues to do surgeries at a more affordable price), and get him a PU surgery for $2000. We agreed, paid the $1770 we owed, and he came home and we monitored him. He didn’t move positions for the entire rest of the day or the night. By the next morning (today), he had still not eaten and had not gone to the bathroom. We knew not getting him the PU surgery was depriving him of life-saving care, so off he went in hopes of receiving the surgery. In line at Kinder, when they heard he was blocked they bumped him to the front of the line and took him inside to start working on the unblocking asap. His new bloodwork showed that his kidneys were not yet a candidate for PU surgery. After they unblocked him again there, only blood was coming out.They urged us to allow him to be hospitalized there for 2 more days while they flushed out his kidneys aggressively, in hopes that he could receive the PU surgery as early as Wednesday. Hospitalization, bloodwork, X-rays, and the actual PU surgery was now going to cost $3310. Totaling $5080 spent on Simba in the past 24 hours. Both invoices from MASH and Kinder are posted here. Currently, Simba is hospitalized with Kinder4Rescue getting his kidneys flushed & we expect to receive the next update this Wednesday 5/17 on whether he is a candidate to proceed with PU surgery. If not, he will need to remain hospitalized for 2 more days (they only perform surgeries M/W/F) and run bloodwork again Friday to check if he can have surgery then. We will provide all updates here as we get them. The goal for Simba is to get him completely healthy, prevent any future blockages, and eventually find him the perfect forever home in a solo-cat household with a loving family who would never even fathom the idea of abandoning him. Thank you for taking the time to read & digest the sadness of Simba’s story. We welcome any donations to help towards his vet bills. No amount is too small, anything helps.

    "text": "We have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to purchase land in the IBA Mashpi-Pachijal. My name is Sergio Basantes and many of you will have visited our family eco-tourism project, the Mashpi Amagusa Reserve, located in the heart of the Choco-Andino Biosphere near Quito, Ecuador. I am personally asking for your help to raise $80,000 to purchase 62 hectares of primary forest as soon as possible. If you have visited, you understand the importance of our reserve and how we protect the land from logging, mining, and cattle farming. What you may not know is that we do not own all of the property where the reserve operates. This large portion of the reserve is owned by an association located outside of Pacto. They have allowed us to operate our business for the last decade or so on land that includes ten sources of crystalline water that feed the Mashpi River. It is a very special place, full of waterfalls and birdsong. This land is home to several species of frogs, including the recently discovered Mashpi Glass Frog, dozens of varieties of beautiful orchids, several species of mammals like the Puma Juagarundi, and 433 species of birds, including the brilliant Glistening Green Tanager, the rare Choco Vireo, and the vulnerable Cloud-forest Pygmy-Owl, to name a few. The association wants to sell the property very soon. Fortunately, they are offering my family an opportunity to purchase the land before it goes on the market. It's now or never. If we can raise 50% of the total, the association will entrust us with a contract to complete the purchase. While they have given not provided us with a deadline, they are hoping for a firm yes within the next 30 days. Without your support, this opportunity will slip through our hands. Remember, if we can raise $40,000 this month, it will give us time to raise the remainder without worry that the land will be sold to someone else. WE ARE COUNTING ON YOU! Your donation makes all the difference. Gratefully, Sergio Basantes y mis amigos aplumados(my feathered friends) My family is very grateful to Nature Experience who are providing a US bank account located in Minneapolis, MN for this fundraiser. Thank you to Abby Eaton for the cover photo, Jose Antonio Jaramillo for the bird photography, and Angie Drake for the English-language translation.",

    "text": "Hi, I'm Dillon from Dirt Life Media! I'm trying to raise money to help support the efforts to keep our sand dunes clean, and litter free! I built a trash trailer, that gets towed to popular meetup spots to help keep litter out of the sand, and a magnet that attaches to the front of my UTV that picks up nails from pallet burners out of our campgrounds and OHV areas. We are trying to raise money to help keep the efforts going and fight the war on trashl! We are trying to build a second trailer that has more capacity and is more capable of getting further into the dunes and deserts. One of our goals is to bring a tractor with a beach cleaner in tow to reclaim our dunes and make Glamis better than its ever been. We, are taking the fight head-on in Glamis first, but will be continuing our efforts to other parts of the country, as we travel on our tour and clean different OHV areas!Follow along on our Instagram page at Dirt Life Media! How'd I end up here.........? I don't think anyone has ever quite heard this FULL story...so here we go!Last year, I was trying to figure out my life and decided to take a risk on myself. Dirt Life Media (my content channel) was starting to get calls to be places, I didn't like what I was doing, and I was sick of Colorado and the snow. So I sold my house and bought a toy hauler and set sail for the unexpected. My goal was to live life on the road for a year, do this UTV event tour I planned for Dirt Life, see some cool things, meet some good people, and hopefully have all of the answers I was looking for by the end of the year. I didn't do the last part but the others were well checked off. The plan was to travel to all of my bucket list places to ride my UTV while growing my content channel and doing videoes for different companies for different things....I was hitting all the events and shows I could.....one of the events on the schedule landed me at the Winchester Bay Sand Dunes in Oregon. I was up there to film some content for a few companies and be an influencer at the event. The event was awesome, the people were great. Riding the beach was incredible; the scenery was next level......I was camped right in the middle of the sand for the event, STAGE CAMPING. I woke up Sunday morning, and almost all of the campers were cleared out....I looked around, and the place looked filthy....literally dirty apartment status. The main firepit was littered with nails....there was everything from your typical paper plates, to full tents in the bushes...we pulled out chunks of concrete, pallets and plywood, coolers, wheels....it was bad! I was living on the road, and I didn't have to leave for anything.....so I stayed. I stayed for almost 3 weeks after that, parked in that same spot....made a deal with the rangers to let me stay, as long I was cleaning.....I went out several times a day, and swept that whole place, with the help of a few awesome locals. Came time to roll to my next event.....UTV Invasion in Nephi, UT at the Little Sahara Recreation Area. We rolled into the main campground, Sand Mountain....huge flat area....COVERED in nails...you couldn't take a step without having to avoid them. We had to make a run to town, for supplies later that afternoon, so we stopped into Harbor Freight and got a rolling magnet. We got back to the dunes, and put it to use immediately! Couldn't even count how many hours I spent pacing, back and forth, in our vendor area.....It felt embarrassing to me, and it wasn't anything I had to do with. Others noticed we had the magnet out, and joined in and asked to use it at their campsite. It was cool to see the magnet get passed from camp to camp, and we had quite the pile by the end of the week! As I continued on my travels, from destination to destination, event to event...I would stay afterwards, and post videos of what these gorgeous places look like when the crowds leave,,,and then clean it up myself. That ALL inspired this.....we built this custom setup trash trailer, to help promote the cleanliness of the dunes....and we have been towing it around the Glamis Sand Dunes to different meetup spots, (Oldsmobile Hill, the drags, and Swingset) to help cut down on the littering from weekenders, and I also take it out on solo missions to clean day to day during the week. I have been taking the magnet out and sweeping areas littered with nails, and the piles are starting to get BIG. We are taking a problem, that is typically dull, and bringing positive attention to it. We REALLY are having an impact, and I want to take it further. We not only make a difference by the trash we pick up.....but we make a lasting impression on ANYONE who sees us out there doing our thing, or the videos we create from it. So here's the deal.......I want to keep this going, bringing our trash trailer and magnet to different OHV areas across the country, cleaning our campgrounds and sandboxes, to help ensure they stay open for generations to come and enjoy...But I need help, and I'm coming to you guys, the people who share the same love for these places as me. Jax Metal Fabrication designed and built the entire magnet structure and did all of the fabrication work on the trailer, including our side car seat, steps, tabs, brackets, etc. Levi and his team have over 120 hours of shop labor into this project to get it to what it is. Our invoice with them was $5800......very reasonable for a community solution to keep trash out of our dunes and we've literally prevented thousands of lost tires with the magnet. But it's still real money....and it takes real gas to get the setup to these community meetups and gatherings for use. And I am asking for help from the community it was built for to keep it going! We are trying to get our nonprofit started, Dirty Hands Clean Sands, to grow this into our full vision, but in the meantime many people have requested I do this, as an easy way of helping keep this community purpose-built project funded, and out where it belongs, making a difference. I want to raise funds to help keep us out here fighting to keep our deserts clean! These places give us all so much joy and happiness, its time we give back! I want to give the people who are willing to donate their hard-earned money, a place where they can see what it's doing, and the impact it's having on the places it was promised. Your time, attention, and support have been amazing and I can't wait to see where WE can take this! ANYTHING and EVERYTHING is helpful to keep us out here fighting trash, and is GREATLY APPRECIATED! If you have any questions or want to know more, send me a message and I'd be happy to go into further details! Thank you! -DillonDirt Life Media",

Imbued with a singular view and energy you’ve got to feel to believe, it has also had the misfortune of becoming a clandestine dump over recent years, with no clear way out. Enter: TRASH JAM. In pocas palabras, a Garbage Concert, Refuse Fest, Pickup Revue, etc. Show up, grab a bag, pick up some plastic to live Basura Music, and before you know it, boom! Bye bye basurero. The first of what we hope to be many, this cross-cultural, multi-generational initiative aims to create a model for fun mass landfill removal, bring together foreign and local musicians, highlight topics like ancestral trail renewal, native flora rewilding, revival of traditional eco-friendly packaging elements, and promotion of local edible foodstuffs that grow in the myriad micro-climates of the canyon and hills. We have the permission, infrastruture, and team for this event, and the support of a dozen local businesses and hotels, but in order to pull it off we'll need the equivalent of your everyday bottle of Patron Guillermo del Toro – i.e. around 2500 USD – to cover bands, sound, stages (main and secondary), local outreach, transport, and publicity. The plan with this particular spot is to leave it undeveloped as a protected public green space, put measures in place to ensure it is never used as a landfill again, and use it to highlight other potential natural heritage zones for future events, both nearby and around the world. Any contribution you give now will be worth gold down the road, and give a dozen local artists – including local indigenous bands, visiting city artists, and musicians from around Atitlán – a boost when they could use it most. ___ Imagínalo: un pedacito de verde ensoñado bajo la mirada inquebrantable del gran Potrero en San Pablo la Laguna, Guatemala, con vista a uno de los lagos más bien hechos del planeta, accesible solo a través de los callejones más estrechos o una serie de pendientes escarpadas por campos de maíz. Imbuido de una mirada singular y con una energía que hay que sentir para creer, también ha tenido la desgracia de convertirse en los últimos años en un vertedero clandestino, sin una salida clara. Entra: TRASH JAM. En pocas palabras, un Concierto Basura, Refuse Fest, Recoge Revue, etc. Preséntate, agarre una bolsa, recoge unos residuos mientras suena la banda, y de repente ¡bum! Adiós basurero. La primera de las que esperamos sean muchas, esta iniciativa intercultural y multigeneracional tiene como objetivo crear un modelo divertido para la eliminación masiva de vertederos clandestinos, reunir a músicos locales y extranjeros, destacar temas como la renovación de senderos ancestrales, la recuperación de la flora autóctona, el renacimiento de elementos de empaque ecológicos tradicionales y promoción de alimentos comestibles locales que crecen en la miríada de microclimas del cañón y las colinas. Tenemos el permiso, la infraestructura y el equipo para este evento, y el apoyo de empresas y hoteles locales, pero para llevarlo a cabo necesitaremos el equivalente a su botella diaria de Patrón Guillermo del Toro, es decir, alrededor de 2500 USD – para cubrir bandas, sonido, escenarios (principal y secundario), difusión local, transporte y publicidad. El plan con este lugar en particular es dejarlo sin desarrollar como un espacio verde público protegido, implementar medidas para garantizar que nunca más se use como vertedero, y usarlo para resaltar otras zonas potenciales de patrimonio natural para futuros eventos, bien cercanos como alrededor del mundo. Cualquier contribución que haga ahora valdrá oro en el futuro, y le dará a una docena de artistas locales, incluidas bandas indígenas locales, artistas de la ciudad visitantes y músicos de todo Atitlán, un impulso cuando más lo necesiten.",

    "text": "Signature Southern Bistro – New Roads, LA I, Susan Early, obtained a restaurant in the Heart of the Historical District on Main Street in New Roads, LA. Prior to receiving the keys to the building I had an opportunity to meet the owner/landlord and discuss the “future of the space” that I would be occupying. The gentleman stated I would be given a 5 year lease to conduct the business plan I had in place “Signature Southern Bistro”. During this time we discussed what upgrades would be needed in order to safely and in accordance with DHH standards of operating a restaurant within that space. I received permission to make any necessary upgrades and/or changes to the building because it was agreed that at its present state it was very outdated. The upgrades and changes would ensure I would be able to pass all necessary inspections to successfully open the restaurant. After this meeting the process was in play to have the company come in to see what was needed and if any other services were needed outside of their scope of specialty service. The owner/landlord was advised on the plans for the building and what was being completed. At one point he was contacted in regards to an issue within the building that was causing problems with continued repairs. Upon his arrival he was completely in aww of the amount of work and detail had been put into the space thus far. During which upon completion of the required documents for key exchange he advised that he would only do a 1 year lease instead of the 5 yr. that was agreed upon. I felt I had to continue with what was offered because I had already started on repairs and upgrades with his permission. We proceeded to finalize the endeavor and I was able to successfully complete all upgrades and repairs to pass inspection and open my restaurant. Fast forward to brainstorming on an event that I thought would be great to show support for individuals within the community by hosting a “Drag Brunch” at my restaurant set for April 2023. Immediately following the announcement of the brunch along with public advertising around the month of February 2023. I was contacted by the daughter of the owner/landlord that it would be in my best interest to cancel the brunch because the community did not need that type of audience and if I did not do so that I should then expect circumstances to follow. As time progressed, my family began to receive death threats from individuals in regards to the Drag Brunch so much that the story was picked up my local new networks. Threats of being lynched called into my restaurant, staff being shouted at from the streets while outside working, area churches held meetings and sent memo’s to members in regards to the upcoming event, being contacted via phone which is listed in my personal medical records by my personal primary care physician’s office thinking I had a scheduled appointment to find myself being questioned by the Charge Nurse about my event and hoping they could speak with me an deter me from going forward with the event without the physician’s knowledge of which all were recorded by myself. There were police reports made along with other documented instances of this type of behavior. I was also told online while advertising on my business page from a member of our community that I could have the event but it will cost me my business. In the month of March 2023; it was time for my lease to be renewed. I contacted the owner/landlord in that regard and he stated he would have the lease completed and ready for renewal however it would probably come with stipulations and a possible increase of $100.00. In April 2023, I began experiencing issues with the AC system within the building. I had the company that came out to complete initial repairs and upgrades along with electrical repair to check what the issues maybe. They were unable to find issues with anything within the building. I then contacted the owner/landlord to advise of the issue and ask can he have the building itself checked. He then stated it was probably some upgrade I had completed; I then had to company contact him to advise that everything completed was up to code and in accordance with the building schematic and electrical output. This was concluded it was not any of the repairs/upgrades. Communication from the owner/landlord ceased without response about AC repair. In the same month, I was a host for False River Wine Down in which the AC was not working properly and the owner/landlord was contacted without response. Immediately following was the Drag Brunch in which went off with a success despite the obstacles. During the event it was extremely hot to the point we kept the doors open to the restaurant. Once again contact was made without assistance. During this entire process I continued to pay the lease after March 2023 in which it was due to be renewed. The payments were accepted by the owner/landlord’s business office. Each time I would leave messages with the office to have him call so we can get the lease signed and finalized. I did not receive a return call. Following the success of the Drag Brunch and issues with the AC, the company I used to complete upgrades/repairs decided to come back out to investigate further since I had not received any assistance with the issue. It was then discovered the main unit on the back of building accessible by ladder lever was turned from the “On” position to “Off” in which I have a video of. I then contacted the owner/landlord and he did not want to speak with me in regards to anything involving the building or my lease. He then advised that I need to vacate his building by June 15th with no further discussion and hung up the phone. Following this I was able to speak to the individual’s attorney that aided in the initial lease, I advised that the owner/landlord refused to repair necessary day to day amenities within the building that affected customers and staff. We were advised the back and forward to have the AC repaired is what caused the lease to be terminated. We are currently allowed to remove all food equipment/upgrades and 30,000 fire prevention system upon returning the keys. The company that made the repairs is aware of what has transpired and has offered to remove the equipment, etc. without cost.  We are kindly asking that anyone that can donate to us it is so appreciated. We want to bring Signature Southern Bistro back but without the proper funding we cannot. We would like to possibly buy a building instead of leasing. We spent our entire life savings in the current building and we have to start over again. We donated to so many people and causes and we are hoping that you can donate to us. We appreciate any donation that is given and your thoughts and prayers are appreciated at this time. ",

Our shop has been a dream come true for us, and we have poured our hearts and souls into making it a welcoming and vibrant space for our community. We have formed close relationships with our customers, who have become like family to us. However, we are facing a major challenge. Due to a development project in our area, we have been given 90-day notice that we have to leave our current space. It's been a devastating blow to us, as we have put so much love and care into making this shop our home. We are determined to find a new space in our community, but the prices are soaring due to gentrification. It's becoming increasingly difficult to find affordable spaces for small businesses like ours. We're afraid that we might have to close our doors permanently, which would be a devastating loss for us and our community. We're reaching out to you today to ask for your help. With your donations, we can secure a new space in our neighborhood and keep The Plant Chica alive and thriving. Every dollar counts, and we would be forever grateful for your support. Our shop is more than just a business to us. It's a place where people cancome together, connect with nature, and form meaningful relationships with one another. We've hosted countless community events, donated plants to local schools and community centers, and provided a space for our customers to come and unwind after a long day. We want to keep serving our community and giving back in any way we can. With your help, we can make that happen. Your donation will go towards rent, utilities, and other expenses associated with moving to a new location. We commit to using your contribution to create a new home for The Plant Chica that will be just as welcoming and vibrant as our current space. Thank you for considering supporting us in this difficult time. Your support means the world to us, and we're confident that together, we can keep The Plant Chica alive and keep our community flourishing. With love and gratitude,Your family at The Plant Chica",

The Saline County Library Alliance formed to defend and support the Saline County Library from the recent rise of anti-community, extremist attacks on the library and its staff. They’ve created a hate-filled website, and are advertising it using a billboard in Benton. We’d like to be able to promote the truth about our library using the same method, but we don’t have their funding off-hand. Billboards in the Benton/Bryant area can cost as much as $4,000 monthly with one quote we received being $3,000. We’re asking for $3500 to meet that quote with a bit of wiggle room if it’s needed. If we meet that goal or more, any extra funds will go either toward a longer rental period of the billboard or to other means of community outreach for the SCLA. If we don’t, we’ll put any funds raised toward outreach as well. Regardless, ALL funds raised will be used to notify members of the community about the SCLA and to promote the library and its services.",

Basically, these games consist of thousands of the best athletes competing accross a wide range of sports all doing their best for their country. Our Aussie team is ranked in the top 4 and I think we can really give things a shake this year. We recently won gold in the Oceanic Games in Brisbane and would love to follow up with a great showing in France. As I am getting old (30) I am thinking of hanging up the boots soon and this is a tournament I would hate to miss out on.

Olivia, (12yrs), is currently the 2 times Scottish Grand Prix Gold medallist, British Gold medallist, Irish International Open Champion and the Central England International Open Champion. She took part in the Commonwealth Karate Championship last year in which she ranked 5th in her category. Olivia has been training in Karate for almost 9 years now, medalling in almost every competition she has entered including the Scottish Kata Championships in which she won Gold at only 9 years old. As a self-funded athlete, it is difficult to find the financial backing to develop and move forward in this sport, restricting opportunities due to monetary constraints which is why we are reaching out to you for your support.

John continues his studio practice in the midst of this but needs help especially to archive and preserve the body of work he has been dedicated to for the last 5 decades. The funds will go to the digitizing of hundreds of VHS tapes and CDs of his (BigHat’s) performances along with digital photograpy of thousands of watercolor, oil, and acrylic paintings. We wish to construct an artist archive online that we will work to place at different institutions. Any amount helps and is greatly appreciated. If you’d like more background on John and BigHat’s work, please continue reading… BigHat has been working tirelessly since the last millennium churning out painting after painting for low pay and under tight deadlines as an artist helping John Bjerklie realize the “SlowHealingTrain” project of painting a portrait of every person in the world by the year 2099. These live painting sessions have taken place in a wide variety of venues from art galleries, city parks, broom closets, schools, art fairs, news stands, bars and, during the 2020 pandemic, by way of FaceTime and Zoom. The idea is simple, BigHat wishes to celebrate every person on the planet by saluting them by doing each other’s portraits. Simple as that seems, it has produced a massive catalogue of artworks by BigHat and friends. Many of the live portrait painting sessions, where BigHat and a visiting artist paint each other’s portraits, have been recorded on VHS and there is a massive amount of footage recording these now historical performances. On behalf of John Bjerklie’s SlowHealingTrain Production, BigHat would love to thank you personally, but he is too busy working on his next portrait.",

    "text": "R/JA new adaptation of Romeo & Juliet at Strand Theater Company in Baltimore City. With a trans Romeo and a fat Juliet at its center, this newly-devised adaptation Queers more than just the lovers’ relationship: family structures, violence, love, duty, identity, and even death. In every possible aspect of the production, we are centering Trans folks, Queer folks, fat folks, BIPOC folks, and women - all badass artists local to Baltimore. Quite simply, seeing these kinds of bodies showing up with revolutionary joy in roles traditionally reserved for thin cisgender heterosexual people makes an enormous impact. Stories told with passionate, radical authenticity are signposts shifting culture toward truth. Artist flight and exhaustion is unfortunately endemic to small cities like Baltimore, where avenues of opportunity are narrow and often traditionally proscribed. Creators who challenge these strict, old-school norms often feel isolated and are forced to migrate to larger city centers in hopes of finding artistic community. R/J seeks to call that opportunity back home to the city we love. Baltimore has an evolving, diverse Queer scene that must be represented on its stages. We insist that our audiences recognize themselves, their legacy, and their beautiful city. R/J will play at The Strand, a local independent theatre in the Hamilton neighborhood of Baltimore City, which only produces works by women and gender-expansive artists while maintaining a commitment to serve its community. Tickets run only $10-20 for each audience member at The Strand in an effort to make theatre truly accessible to its surrounding neighborhoods. R/J has been a long time in the making, in more ways than one, and we can’t wait to share it with the folks who need it. From Betse (Juliet / Conceiving Artist):Unfortunately, much of our society still thrives on ignoring the fact that fat bodies exist. The stage is no exception to this rule; in fact, it is a primary arbiter. If fat actors are “lucky” enough to be cast, they are relegated to the role of sidekick, comic-relief, or even worse, villain. (We are shown right from the beginning, in children’s media, that fat people are only ever cast as evil or bad.) In all my years in theatre, I have never once been cast in a lead role. Whether consciously or unconsciously, those in charge of casting have looked at me and not seen someone who could possibly be the center of a story. R/J upends that. It places a fat femme at the center of not just any story, but a love story - one that is considered by many to be the most romantic of all time. This is exactly why we created R/J, to give people a chance to see just how beautiful it can be to allow marginalized bodies to breathe new life into characters we thought we knew. From O’Malley (Romeo / Conceiving Artist):Sometimes being a gender-expansive actor means people not knowing what to do with you and that simply means you have to tell them. You have to show them. As a Trans human I feel I have been engaged in a state of constant self awareness and reflection from a very young age. An ongoing state of transition - to seek, to find, to never completely know the answer, or exactly who I am, or what’s coming next. I embrace this state of transition for it is in those definitives that authenticity is lost. “Trans–moving across, beyond, through, changing thoroughly.Isn’t this the life of an artist?”-Will Davis, artistic director–Rattlestick Theater I’ve often felt isolated and exhausted by the emotional labor of being the only trans artist in the room. Working and existing in environments in which the people around me perhaps do not see me in my entirety. Feeling as though I don’t always fit the stories being told. So. We write them. We re-tell them. We show up and we show them. I believe in theatre that makes euphoria accessible through stories that demonstrate it is attainable.I believe that by holding space for ourselves, we create space for others.I believe in no longer waiting to initiate collaboration across all underserved identities and communities toward collective change in the theatre.I believe in theatre that challenges its audience to question and engage with their relationship to self. R/J encompasses all of this and more. “Queer is not an ‘instead of’, it’s an ‘inclusive of’”.-Adele Morrison I hope you’ll join us.

Tickets for the full broadcast can be purchased at Moment.co via this link to view the telethon with bonus live performances by your favorite queens and A-list talent. For general information on the Drag isn’t Dangerous campaign, please visit www.dragisntdangerous.com. According to the ACLU, there are currently 467 bills in the United States legislature targeting the LGBTQIA+ community. Many seek to ban drag on public property, as well as in any locations where individuals under the age of 18 could be present. A significantly more dangerous series of bills are the ones seeking to ban age appropriate, medically necessary care to transgender youth under the age of 18. Several states are already trying to extend these harmful bans to include gender affirming care for adults. This proposed legislation is a direct attempt to force the LGBTQIA+ community, particularly transgender and non-binary individuals, back into the closet, and the number of bills is growing exponentially by the week. Many of these bills, if passed, will prove deadly for trans youth across the country. As anti-trans rhetoric continues to spread, it’s no coincidence that according to the 2019 annual FBI Hate Crime Statistics report, nearly 1-in-5 of any type of hate crime is motivated by Anti-LGBTQIA+ bias. Drag Isn't Dangerous is a new charitable effort led by LGBTQ management firm Producer Entertainment Group in partnership with Black Queer Town Hall, a registered 501c3 charity. Co-presenters include GLAAD, GLSEN, HeadCount, UTA, Concord, Queerty, Obsessed, Loyal Studios, OUTtv, SERV Vodka and others. The Drag isn't Dangerous event: On Sunday, May 7, many of the biggest names in entertainment are coming together to raise funds for LGBTQIA causes to fight back against the recent false political narrative that drag queens and trans people are dangerous to children and society. All funds raised will go exclusively to nonprofits focused on LGBTQ activism as well as local charities combating harmful bills against the LGBTQIA+ communities across the nation. A list of nonprofits is ongoing. **Please note, a donation is not a ticket to watch the telethon. Tickets can be purchased separately at Moment.co via this link to view the telethon with bonus live performances by your favorite queens and A-list talent. Drag Isn’t Dangerous is partnering with Black Queer Town Hall, a 501c3 charity organization founded by Bob the Drag Queen and Peppermint. Black Queer Town Hall will be providing Drag Isn’t Dangerous with financial sponsorship for their tax exempt status, accounting, holding of all funds, and reporting. All donors will receive a receipt for tax purposes. The following organizations have been named as beneficiaries, with more to come: GLAADGLSENHeadcountBlack Queer Town HallThe ACLU Drag Defense FundTrans Justice Funding ProjectLGBTQ+ Victory Institute We've set our goal at $250,000 to start, and will continuously increase the goal as we meet it. We hope to raise as much money as we can for this initiative. We are still hoping to add a few more hyper-local groups doing work on the ground in Tennessee, Florida and elsewhere. But it is important for potential donors to know that none of us who are organizing or appearing at this event are taking fees. There will be some hard production costs given the scale of the event, but this is truly a charitable effort with no personal gain, and hopefully a blueprint for how PEG and our artists can engage in philanthropy moving forward. For more information visit the Drag isn't Dangerous website here. BQTH is committed to celebrating black queer excellence by supporting and cultivating community, sharing knowledge, and uplifting voices. BQTH will be the beneficiary of this fundraiser, and will evenly distribute the donations raised to all benefiting charities. As an organization, Black Queer Town Hall has a full-time staff and has raised over a million dollars toward charitable initiatives since its inception in 2020. How to reach the telethon lines: Queens will be standing by to receive calls and give thanks as donations come in throughout the evening.

And, behind the scenes, it was one of the most difficult festivals that our independent community-based production company has ever put on. We were challenged by a number of factors, most of which were beyond our control, including:Wettest weather in a decade, rendering our across-the-river parking unusableThe expense of an offsite parking lot, box office, and shuttle serviceInflation and the rising cost of production servicesA shipment of bamboo we were importing from Colombia got held up in US Customs and we were charged demurage fees for over 7 months while we attempted to get it out.Reduced number of ticket sales due to community uncertainty around the challenges we were facing with off-site parking and shuttle operations At the end of the day, as the dust settles, we are staring at a $400k deficit. We are committed to ensuring that all employees and contractors are paid for their efforts, and as such have secured loans to do so.

This year after the event on the way home we had the back axel break and had to leave her down in Texas to be repaired and rent a Uhaul to get back home with our supplies, we are hoping you will help us cover the repairs and the rest of the other costs we will have getting her back to Michigan. I am designing a special limited edition t-shirt I saved the Short Bus for all that donate over $50we do this event as a labor of love to help inspire the youth so we can use your support.Thank You for taking the time to read this and hopefully some support, any and all donations will help!",

Last night as we enjoyed the lakers game and dominoes a young man came into where we were playing & said someone took his parking spot. As we get up to figure out who had to move their car the young man fired a shot at Bradley unprovoked and hit him in the stomach . The bullet did significant damage to his abdomen & has more surgeries to come. His family is from Barbados and the funds are to cushion the blow for them to be present in this time of need. Bradley is a SUCCESS story. To know him is to love him as soon as he enters the room he is a shape shifter.He is LSU Graduate, proud Omega Psi Phi fraternity brother, a brother to me and a great friend to many at our place of employment. God Bless & thank you in advance",

We have worshiped at this site as a Lutheran congregation continuously since 1862. We have served the community of Western New York faithfully. The church, sanctuary, narthex and contents of the church are severely damaged and a total loss. Over 170 years of our church history has been destroyed, but we remain devoted and committed to rise from the ashes and help fulfill God’s mission for our congregation. St. Paul’s Lutheran has been filled with love, hope kindness and caring for others in need and will continue to do so in spite of the devastating loss and grief we feel because of the fire. We will rebuild and are comforted by the words of Isaiah 41:13- “For I am the Lord your God, who takes hold of your right right hand and says to you, Do not fear; I will help you.” St. Paul's Lutheran is more than just a location to worship; we are people of God. Contributions will go to rebuilding our place of worship and help us complete our mission as brothers and sisters of Christ.",

He beat her senselessly with her cane, a brick and threw sewing machines at her. The only thing that saved her life was pretending to be dead until he left and she was able to call for help. She was taken immediately to the hospital and admitted. She has suffered substantial injuries from the brutal beating and the doctors are expecting a few weeks for recovery due to her age and the severity. The Yuma Police department arrested the individual responsible and he is currently being held for attempted murder during the active investigation.If you know Rose, you know that she is a woman that works hard for what she has and does not ever ask anyone for help. We are asking for help. Your donation will help her with bills, repairing the damages in the shop and the few weeks she will be missing work. She is one of the strongest people we have ever known, still working her 9-5 and never expecting any handouts. She prides herself on working hard to keep her customers happy and her shop open.

Over the last 15 months, they have been honeymooning all over the US and even into Mexico in their self converted camper van with their dog, Pepe. They’ve visited many national parks, close to 40 states and have just simply been living their best life. Unfortunately, their beloved 13 year old pup, Pepe.. passed away unexpectedly in April. Followed by additional bad news, that Dave’s critically ill father was hospitalized in New York. They were on their way back to New York from California when they noticed something wasn’t right with the van. They quickly brought it to a shop in Tennessee for inspection and were hopeful it wasn’t anything major. Due to time constraints, they had decided to leave the van at the shop for evaluation and rent an SUV to get back to NY for Dave’s father. After finally arriving to NY and spending time with Dave’s father. They got word from the mechanics that the damage was worse than they thought. And they were told their transmission would need to be rebuilt. It’s now estimated to be about $5000. On top of that, Dave’s father passed away today . With the amount of devastating news these two have been through I’m hoping this campaign will help them get their home on wheels back on the on road! I can’t believe everything they’re going through right now. And I know times are tough for everyone, but any little bit you can give will help them during this time.",

My cousin and best friend Alex Schachter was killed by a 19-year-old with an AR-15 in Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland on Valentine's Day in 2018. For five years, I have been fighting for a federal assault weapons ban and I have seen little to no progress. Now, more and more Americans are getting hunted and killed by shooters with weapons of war that were legally purchased. I have been to DC numerous times to share my story with countless members of Congress to change their hearts and minds but they simply don't care. I am so sick and tired of waking up and learning that there has been another mass shooting, and then seeing absolutely nothing being done about the murder weapon. That is why I will be sitting in at the U.S. Capitol starting June 6th to demand a vote in both houses of Congress for a federal assault weapons ban. This is an accountability vote to expose who is stopping this bill from passing and putting guns over children's lives. I invite other gun violence survivors and advocates to join me. We will need donations in order to feed people, and get blankets/sleeping bags for everyone. Any amount will help us. This is a fight for not only your children's lives, but your brother's, sister's, parent's, and even, yourself. We are all at risk. Please trust me when I say I never thought gun violence would affect my life. Don't wait until it destroys yours too. Thank you for your support.Sincerely,Sam",
